title: Ruby GUI

Ruby is quite powerful as a programming language, and also is quite a tool to implement Desktop applications.

In this list available in [Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/GUI_Toolkit_Modules), we can find several toolkits for building applications. In this list, we can see that most of the GUI are written in pure Ruby.

The most popular toolkit listed is [**Shoes**](https://github.com/shoes/shoes), initially developed by the missing Rubyist [_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), and currently maintained by other developers. The Toolkit offers a easy [DSL (domain-specific language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to simply develop a desktop application purely in Ruby.

Shoes can be found for download on this [site](http://shoesrb.com/) and also in its repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/shoes/shoes). After downloading Shoes, you can run the examples that are included in the package, where the Shoes shows what you can do with the Toolkit in a few lines of code.

Among the examples, what struck me was the example tankspank.rb expert-developed by Kevin Conner. The example implements a small game, where you control a tank with mouse clicks in a small maze.
