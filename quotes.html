        Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

    <blockquote>
        Building an object-oriented application means inventing appropriate machinery. We represent real-world information, processes, interactions, relationships, even errors, by inventing objects that don't exist in the real world. We give life and intelligence to inanimate things. We take difficult-to-comprehend real-world objects and split them into simpler, more manageable software ones. We invent new objects. Each has a specific role to play in the application. Our measure of success lies in how clearly we invent a software reality that satisfies our application's requirements -- and not in how closely it remembers the real world.

    <blockquote>
        If we accept that we reflect values into code whether we want or not, we can't look into the monitor. We have to look into the mirror. If we can be mindful of the values we reflect into our code; if we can approach our craft with humility and an understanding of our limitations; if we can admit that cleverness is no substitute for compassion; if we can acknowledge that we always have a perspective and it is only one of many perspectives; if we can embrace ambiguity; if we can view our designs as a conversation rather than a declaration; if we can bring these human values to our code, we stand a chance of bringing soul to software.
